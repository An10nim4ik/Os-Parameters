# Os-Parameters
I made a programm that gets the information about OS, storage, IP and current User.
With help of library "platform" we get access to a OS on a device that you're using right now and what version it is.
Uisng the second library "psutil" it gives access to information about RAM and disk storage.
"getpass" is a library that helps to get information about current user that is using device in that time.
Library called "socket" help to have access to a IP of the current device that we are using in the mean time.
To get access to environmental variables we have to use library "os".
And last, but not least is "colorama", that is the library that helps to customize the output, for example it can change the colors, fonts, styles and etc. for the output.
